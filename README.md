# shape-factory

• Implement two select elements, one for the shapes and one for the colours.
• Create a box (grid) to contain at least 20 different shapes (circles and squares).
• Add the necessary style for circles and squares. Colours will be defined via JavaScript.
• Create a class named Shape with a constructor, 2 accessor properties (name and colour) and 
1 method (getInfo()).
• Name and colour (actually _name and _colour) must be accessed through get properties.
• The ‘Create’ button will create a Shape object, save it in an array and add a new shape (div) 
to the grid. This div is the HTML representation of the JavaScript object.
• Implement a function named createShape() to create and append a shape to the grid box.
• getInfo() returns the name of the shape and its colour. This method is called when the user 
clicks on one of the shapes.
